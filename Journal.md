**June13**

- finalized that i will be using RP2040 for this project and decided that i won't add any knob or display, i will use cherry mx brown switches for this keyboard.
- I want to keep it a simple keyboard which does it's job.

**June14**

- Created the repository
- I will start by creating the layout of the keyboard on the website.
- Completed the layout :

- I rechanged the layout to the default us based qwerty type, because i personally didn.t liked the previous one that much.
