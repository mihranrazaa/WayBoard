A Keyboard Design for ME and YOU

## Overview
a 60% keyboard design With very minimal design, it is based on RP2040 plus with a type C port which came in-built with the MCU, there total of 61 MX switches design with 5 Stabilizer type switches. A small minimal keyboard :).

## Bit in depth info
The keyboard is designed to be sleek and plane it has RP2040 plus as the MCU and Cherry MX Brown Switches for the keys which are used for versatile purposes (that's what i saw at least). The main firmware is KMK based and the Firmware has already been released, you can find that in the Firmware and Production folder, I hate using different cables so having type c inbuilt in the RP2040 plus is a win-win. I added A small space in the bottom right of the keyboard which will act as a handle kind of things and also look good

## Extra Stuff

### Gratitude
- Thanks to Hackclub and Hackpad for making me do this brilliant project, More coming :).
- Thanks to my potato for helping me till the end.
- Thanks to myself for completing the project and not getting distracted with another project.
- And Thank you for Reading?

### Inspiration
**Going to Undercity!!**

### Challanging
The only challanging part was designing the PCB and Schematics, first i was overthinking for what MCU should i choose then i took some time on footprints and symbols..
